Welcome to my multi-user-blog project!
===================


This project uses the Google App Engine Python API to create a blog that users can register and post on.

----------


Files
-------------
> - **main.py** This file is the heart of the blog, it handles all of the get / post requests and interfaces with the datastore to provide content, user registration, login / logout, and  posting / commenting / liking.
> - **/templates** each file in this folder is an HTML template for one of the pages. They are rendered in the jinja2 environment created by main.py

Installation
-------------

> - Download / clone this repository.
> - Navigate to te directory containing main.py
> - run the command "dev_appserver.py ."
