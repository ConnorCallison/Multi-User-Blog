Welcome to my multi-user-blog project!
===================


This project uses the Google App Engine Python API to create a blog that users can register and post on.

----------


Files
-------------
> - **main.py** This file is the heart of the blog, it handles all of the get / post requests and interfaces with the datastore to provide content, user registration, login / logout, and  posting / commenting / liking.
> - **/templates** each file in this folder is an HTML template for one of the pages. They are rendered in the jinja2 environment created by main.py

Installation / testing
-------------
**Requirements:** this project makes use of Google App Engines Pythin API. In order to run or deploy this blog one will need to run through this installation process here: https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/download

> - Download / clone this repository.
> - Navigate to te directory containing main.py
> - run the command "dev_appserver.py ."

Deployment
-------------
> - Once you have made all the changes to the blog that you desire, you can deploy it by running the command "gcloud deploy".
